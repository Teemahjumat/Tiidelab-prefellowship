<p><strong>Criticisms</strong><hr></p>
<p>
    It was emerged that his dawah centre, <sub title="Islamic Propagation Centre International ">IPCI</sub> was financed by the Bin Laden family and that he had met Osama Bin Laden, whom he described positively.
  Deedat's debates and writings have been labelled as a form of apologetics by Lloyd V. J. Ridgeon, professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Glasgow.
      Muslim scholar Farid Esack has criticised Deedat, comparing him to such fundamentalists as Rabbi Meir Kahane and Jerry Falwell, and writing:  
<blockquote cite="http://www.crosscurrents.org/Esack.htm">Deedat's multitude of anti-Christian, anti-Jewish and anti-Hindu videotapes have told us all that there is to be told about the other, and we are comfortable with that. There are times, of course, when questions surface about the importance of correct dogma, about the importance of labels to a God whom we believe sees beyond labels and looks at the hearts of people. Instead of pursuing these questions, we hasten back and seek refuge in "the known." We order another of those Deedat tapes. </blockquote>
